# UFOs
## Overview of Project
For this project, I created a webpage and dynamic table that filters and displays information on UFO sitings. The table allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time, based on the date, city, state, country, and shape.


## Results
As you can see in the attached image below, the webpage allows the user to filter the data by entering information into any one of the 5 filter boxes on the lefthand side of the screen. The webpage will automatically filter the table to display the criteria entered in the fields.

## Summary

After completion of the webpage, the biggest drawback is that the page is not responsive. It would be beneficial if the page and all of its contents would automatically fit onto any sized device that is used to visit the page.  One recommendation would have been to correct the responsiveness of the page, another would be to clean the data in the comments section better before deploying it, as some of the data is jumbled and illegible.
